压力区分Tap和非有意点击

we discuss the importance of the touched state in physical keyboards and why it should be offered in large-size touch screen devices.

# 2018-UbiK

通过麦克风做任意表面上的文本输入法，单键的识别准确率是95%。

纹理信息：kinesthetic feedback

触觉反馈：tactile feedback

重击才算打字-可以将手休息在桌子上：

Unlike on-screen virtual keyboard, UbiK is insensitive to gentle taps and touches.
It allows Finger/wrist rest on the touch surface, thus relieving fatigue [2] caused by hovering.

hover on touchscreen会导致疲劳：

It allows Finger/wrist rest on the touch surface, thus relieving fatigue [2] caused by hovering.

# 2015-SpatialTouch

Touchscreen十指文本输入法中给出声音反馈，让盲人用户可以利用到物理键盘上的习惯。

反馈方式是声音的方向来表示键盘的每一列。

We show that SpatialTouch enables blind users to leverage previous experience as they do a better use of home keys and perform more efficient exploration paths.

button press的神经结构。

# 2018-ImpactActivation

传统键盘上，手指按压过程中就会触发按键信号（工艺原因），这份工作证明，手指按压到底的瞬间触发信号是更好的方式：能够提高用户对点击时间的把控。

# 2018-ForceTap

改进触屏使其提供触觉反馈。

In this paper we report on a novel system that explores the usage of a forcesensitive motion-platform enhanced tablet interface to improve multi-modal interaction based on visuo-haptic.

# 2016-TapBoard2

消除typing和其它动作的歧义，可以在触摸屏上同时支持打字和触摸板控制鼠标。

We introduce TapBoard 2, a touchpad-based keyboard that solves the problem of typing and pointing disambiguation.

It was able to disambiguate typing and pointing actions with an accuracy of greater than 95%.

# 2014-TacileFeedback

"The typing performance and preference costs of reducing tactile feedback and tactile landmarks in tablet keyboards"

The conventional keyboard with tactile landmarks, tactile feedback, and the ability to rest the fingers was significantly better than the other options both in terms of performance and preference

# 2015-OnScreen

触屏输入法中单独的触觉反馈或者声音反馈对输入效率没有帮助。

without additional changes, feedback and tactile landmarks alone do not offer the opportunity to improve the performance of OSKs. 

# 1999-SoftKeyboard

Typing skills transfer from the physical to software keyboards.

# 物理键盘上的touch状态对输入的可用性有帮助

仅仅是键帽的触觉反馈就对输入效率有影响。

# Possible Feedbacks for Touch Screen

solutions providing the touched state in software keyboards is a strong candidate for improving the performance.

TouchFire and SLAP Widget offer a tangible keyboard object on the touch screen.

Tactus technology developed a deformable touch screen surface, which generates physical bumps dynamically.

[Technology, T. http://www.tactustechnology.com/]

TeslaTouch [3] LATPaD [16], and STIMTAC [1] exhibit a dynamically changeable surface texture. The above techniques enable users to get information from the surface of the screen while sweeping their fingers across it.

# Palm rejection on touchscreens

# 2014-PalmRejection

We present a probabilistic touch filtering approach that distinguish between legitimate stylus and palm touches. 

Failure to reject palms effectively in a pen or touch input system results in ergonomic issues [3], accidental activation and unwanted inputs, precluding fluid and efficient use of these input systems.

[3] = Touch Displays: the effects of palm rejection technology on productivity, comfort, biomechanics, and positioning.

# 2020-TabletopTouch

In literature, the issue of unintentional touches has been extensively studied [9, 13, 37, 65], but mostly on mobile devices such as phones and tablets [2, 32, 36]. For instance, some research has looked into palm rejection on mobile devices during tasks such as note-taking and drawing [2, 14, 52].
