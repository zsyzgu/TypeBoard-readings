压力区分Tap和非有意点击

we discuss the importance of the touched state in physical keyboards and why it should be offered in large-size touch screen devices.

# 2018-UbiK

通过麦克风做任意表面上的文本输入法，单键的识别准确率是95%。

纹理信息：kinesthetic feedback

触觉反馈：tactile feedback

重击才算打字-可以将手休息在桌子上：

Unlike on-screen virtual keyboard, UbiK is insensitive to gentle taps and touches.
It allows Finger/wrist rest on the touch surface, thus relieving fatigue [2] caused by hovering.

It allows Finger/wrist rest on the touch surface, thus relieving fatigue [2] caused by hovering.

# 2015-SpatialTouch

Touchscreen十指文本输入法中给出声音反馈，让盲人用户可以利用到物理键盘上的习惯。

反馈方式是声音的方向来表示键盘的每一列。

We show that SpatialTouch enables blind users to leverage previous experience as they do a better use of home keys and perform more efficient exploration paths.

# 2018-ImpactActivation

传统键盘上，手指按压过程中就会触发按键信号（工艺原因），这份工作证明，手指按压到底的瞬间触发信号是更好的方式：能够提高用户对点击时间的把控。

# 2018-ForceTap

改进触屏使其提供触觉反馈。

In this paper we report on a novel system that explores the usage of a forcesensitive motion-platform enhanced tablet interface to improve multi-modal interaction based on visuo-haptic.

# 2016-TapBoard2

消除typing和其它动作的歧义，可以在触摸屏上同时支持打字和触摸板控制鼠标。

We introduce TapBoard 2, a touchpad-based keyboard that solves the problem of typing and pointing disambiguation.

It was able to disambiguate typing and pointing actions with an accuracy of greater than 95%.

# 2014-TacileFeedback

"The typing performance and preference costs of reducing tactile feedback and tactile landmarks in tablet keyboards"

The conventional keyboard with tactile landmarks, tactile feedback, and the ability to rest the fingers was significantly better than the other options both in terms of performance and preference

# 2015-OnScreen

触屏输入法中单独的触觉反馈或者声音反馈对输入效率没有帮助。

without additional changes, feedback and tactile landmarks alone do not offer the opportunity to improve the performance of OSKs. 

# 1999-SoftKeyboard

Typing skills transfer from the physical to software keyboards.

# 物理键盘上的touch状态对输入的可用性有帮助

仅仅是键帽的触觉反馈就对输入效率有影响。

# Possible Feedbacks for Touch Screen

solutions providing the touched state in software keyboards is a strong candidate for improving the performance.

TouchFire and SLAP Widget offer a tangible keyboard object on the touch screen.

Tactus technology developed a deformable touch screen surface, which generates physical bumps dynamically.

[Technology, T. http://www.tactustechnology.com/]

TeslaTouch [3] LATPaD [16], and STIMTAC [1] exhibit a dynamically changeable surface texture. The above techniques enable users to get information from the surface of the screen while sweeping their fingers across it.

# 2014-PalmRejection

We present a probabilistic touch filtering approach that distinguish between legitimate stylus and palm touches. 

Failure to reject palms effectively in a pen or touch input system results in ergonomic issues [3], accidental activation and unwanted inputs, precluding fluid and efficient use of these input systems.

[3] = Touch Displays: the effects of palm rejection technology on productivity, comfort, biomechanics, and positioning.

[stylus - spatiotemporal] Julia Schwarz et al. [52] focused on unwanted interaction triggered by palms on tablets. They used similar spatiotemporal features in [32] to distinguish palm touches from stylus input. Their decision forest model achieved a precision of 97.9% and 0.016 errors/stroke.

# 2020-TabletopTouch

In literature, the issue of unintentional touches has been extensively studied [9, 13, 37, 65], but mostly on mobile devices such as phones and tablets [2, 32, 36]. For instance, some research has looked into palm rejection on mobile devices during tasks such as note-taking and drawing [2, 14, 52].

Unintentional touches 的定义：
We define unintentional touches as those touches that do not contribute to any interaction goal. Previous works also use accidental/unwanted touches [32, 36].

在实验一中，研究了触屏大桌面和普通大桌面上的交互行为。采用了两个任务，地图导航和照片分类。触屏大桌面和普通大桌面上的用户行为，在行为模式、非有意点击数量和心理模型上都有显著差异。

Recently, Serim and Jacucci had an interesting discussion on the distinct definition of explicit vs. implicit interaction, and identified new considerations for design and evaluation of implicit interaction [53].

# 2012-IdentifyUnint

手持触屏设备上（电容屏）的防误触算法，对有意点击的recall-rate是99.2%，但precision只有79.6%。能用的信息只有报点（并没有电容图），仅用到了简单的时空特征，包括触摸时间，触摸移动距离，与边缘的距离，轨迹距离与直线距离的比例。

Matero and Colley [36] tried to classify accidental touch events on mobile phones in daily usage. They investigated numerous typical operations on mobile devices (e.g., sweeping on the screen, device handling and phone calls) and proposed a rule-based classification algorithm according to the contact area and touch duration. Their best algorithm can eliminate 79.6% of unintentional touches with a 0.8% false-positive rate.

# 2015-AlwaysOnGesture

分类了手机黑屏时的有意手势和无意的误触，误触数据的采集从日常生活中来。

Lu and Li [32] analyzed accidental touches during the standby mode of mobile phones. They compared intentional touch gestures and unintentional touches on a turned-off screen, e.g., putting the device in a pocket. They used a number of touch spatiotemporal features such as duration, touch area trajectory, **pressure level** on the screen, and acceleration deviation from the motion sensor to classify whether a touch on a turned-off screen was accidental. Their final decision tree model achieved 98.2% on precision and 97.6% on recall.

# 2014-PenMightier

Annett et al. [1] compared the unintended touches that occurred when using a stylus on digital versus media. **They found that users maintained some unnatural and tiring postures on the digital tablets to avoid unintentional touches caused by their palms**, e.g., floating their hands over the screen.

# 2014-PenUnint

They further investigated different algorithms to remove accidental touches on stylusbased tablets [2]. Their best algorithm used the distance between the screen and the stylus as the threshold and achieved approximately 86% accuracy for the classification.
